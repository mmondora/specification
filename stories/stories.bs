## US01: Marco is positive to the Swab Test ## {#US01}

**Actors:**

- [[#Marco]]
- [[#Giovanni]]

**Preconditions:**

Marco's state is unknown
Giovanni has produced the medical certificate with the patient's state of health and digitally signed it 
using the computer procedures of the hospital in which he operates and stores it digitally in the health repositories. 
In addition, this report must be sent in encrypted mode to the patient.
The medical certificate must be saved in the device inside the App.



**Postcondition:**

Marco’s state is quarantined.

**Story:**

Marco visits Giovanni, who runs a Swab test on him (the result will be available in a few days dependending on the test).
Giovanni asks Marco to install the *Mobile App*. The *Mobile App*
requests Marco to show his face, then he is enrolled in the system. The
app also creates a unique COC_ID, which is associated with Marco’s
information.
Giovanni registers Marco in the operator app which shows a QR-code.
Marco scans the QR-code using his phone then he authenticates himelf to complete the registeration.
At this point, the *Mobile App* shows a single-button
interface that, when pressed, records the current location and sets
it as a possible quarantine location (depending on the test result).
Giovanni instructs Marco to go home
immediately and to press the button on the *Mobile App* once she
arrives. After a predetermined amount of time (e.g., one hour) the
*Mobile App* reminds Marco to press the button. Once at home
Marco opens the *Mobile App* and presses the button. The mobile
app shows a confirmation prompt, and then authenticates Marco
using his face. This saves the current location in the app, and
completes the enrollment process.

After some time, the result of the test is back. Giovanni enters the
result in the operator app, which also notifies Marco’s
*Mobile App*, as well as the authorities.


## US02 - Marco Confirms His Location -- Enforce Quarantine ## {#US02}

**Actors:**

- [[#Marco]]


**Preconditions:**

Marco’s swab test is positive.

**Story:**

Marco receives a notification on the *Mobile App* that requires
him to confirm his location. He taps on the notification, which
brings him into the *Mobile App*. The *Mobile App* asks him
to authenticate using his face and checks that his current location
is close to the location that was selected to complete the
enrollment. The result of this check is reported to the authorities.
If Marco does not respond to the notification in a timely manner
(e.g., within 3 minutes), the *Mobile App* notifies him again.
After a predetermined number of unanswered notifications (say 2),
the *Mobile App* notifies the authorities.
The *Mobile App*
periodically polls Marco’s phone location. If the phone is outside
of the designated quarantine area, it notifies Marco as well as the
authorities.
