## US01: Anne is positive to the Swab Test ## {#US01}

**Actors:**

- [[#Anne]]
- [[#Giovanni]]

**Preconditions:**

Anne's state is unknown
Giovanni has produced the medical certificate with the patient's state of health and digitally signed it 


NOTES: Self Dofraigni Identity could apply



**Postcondition:**

Anne’s state is quarantined.

**Story:**

Anne visits Giovanni, who runs a Swab test on her (the result could be available in a few days depending on the test).
Giovanni asks Anne to install the *Mobile App*. The *Mobile App*
requests Anne to show her face, then she is enrolled in the system. The
app also creates a unique COC_ID, which is associated with Anne’s
information.
Giovanni registers Anne in the operator app which shows a QR-code.
Anne scans the QR-code using her phone then she authenticates herself to complete the registeration.
At this point, the *Mobile App* shows a single-button
interface that, when pressed, records the current location and sets
it as a possible quarantine location (depending on the test result).
Giovanni instructs Anne to go home
immediately and to press the button on the *Mobile App* once she
arrives. After a predetermined amount of time (e.g., one hour) the
*Mobile App* reminds Anne to press the button. Once at home
Anne opens the *Mobile App* and presses the button. The mobile
app shows a confirmation prompt, and then authenticates Anne
using her face. This saves the current location in the app, and
completes the enrollment process.

After some time, the result of the test is back. Giovanni enters the
result in the operator app, which also notifies Anne’s
*Mobile App*, as well as the authorities.

**Actors:**

- [[#Jack]]


**Preconditions:**

Jack’s swab test is positive.

**Story:**

him to confirm his location. He taps on the notification, which
brings him into the *Mobile App*. The *Mobile App* asks him
to authenticate using his face and checks that his current location
is close to the location that was selected to complete the
enrollment. The result of this check is reported to the authorities.
If Jack does not respond to the notification in a timely manner
(e.g., within 3 minutes), the *Mobile App* notifies him again.
After a predetermined number of unanswered notifications (say 2),
the *Mobile App* notifies the authorities.
The *Mobile App*
periodically polls Jack’s phone location. If the phone is outside
of the designated quarantine area, it notifies Jack as well as the
authorities.
